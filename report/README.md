# Tasks

## Task 0
This task is divided into two parts 
* Software installation - installation of ROS kinetic, V-REP, V-REP ROS interface installation.
* Whycon Task - In this task we had to fetch WhyCon marker coordinates of the static marker placed in the V-REP scene by subscribing to markerâ€™s corresponding topics.

## Task 1 : Position Hold and Waypoint navigation.
In this task we were required to design the control algorithm for the drone and also use image processing to detect colors placed in the simulation scene given to us. We also used Plotjuggler - a time-series data visualisation tool; to plot the response of the drone and thus fine tune the gain constants. 

## Task 2: Arena design and Hardware testing.
This task involved testing of the hardware provided to us and also printing of the arena.

## Task 3: Camera calibration and Position Hold.
The USB camera we were provided with was giving distorted image, we had to calibrate the camera using checkerboards.Then we implemented our Parallel PID algorithm on the real drone - Pluto drone.

## Task 4: Theme Implementation.
In this task we had to navigate to different points on the arena provided to using image processing and control algorithm.
